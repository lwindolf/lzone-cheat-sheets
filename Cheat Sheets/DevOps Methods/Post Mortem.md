Blameless post mortems are special meetings that create a shared view on

- what happened
- what we learned
- what we think is worth improving
- and allows tracking what we actually are improving

## When to do it?

Hold a blameless post mortem after each incident, even when you customer didn't "see" anything.

## Measurements



## Important Points

- A post mortem should be blameless
- A post mortem without resulting action points should be rare
- A post mortem must be prepared up front
  - Otherwise you spend the entire meeting on the timeline
  - Have the organizer of the post mortem prepare the timelime upfront as complete as possible
    and only add missing stuff or correct mistakes in the meeting
- Depending on your team apply the Las Vegas principle and keep post mortem details internal
  - Distinguish between customer facing incident management and internal view
  - Skip this if team/org/customer are mature enough
- Use the timeline to do measurements (TTF, TTD, TTR, ..)
- From time to time measure improvement over all incidents (MTTR, ...)
- It is not necessary to always be able to identify the root case
  - It is ok, to note that "we were not able to identify the root case, but we have hypothesis A'
