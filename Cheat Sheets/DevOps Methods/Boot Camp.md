Having a DevOps boot camp is a good way to introduce and scale DevOps practices in a large organization (>100 developers).

## Background

The idea behind boot camps is to do high intensity, high focus onboarding of developers. There is 
a hidden (or maybe explicit) promise:

1. For the development teams: "if you learn the ways of DevOps in the bootcamp you get all the DevOps
   privileges". All others stay unprivileged developers who have to ask Ops to do deployments. If your
   legacy Ops team is still behind in automation this might even mean handing over root access to the
   new DevOps.
3. For the legacy Ops teams: "Nobody who doesn't meet 'your' strict standards gets any privileges."

## When to use

- If you have a mistrusting old-school Ops team, that tendss to continue gatekeeping
- If you have no/insufficient platform self-services yet: the boot camp will show the cost to the Ops/Platform team
- If you quickly want to introduce DevOps in a large set of Dev-Teams. Invite 2 persons of each team to the bootcamp

## How to prepare

- Make a bootcamp plan, use the Ops/platform team onboarding as a template
- Create real worlds steps for the plan, e.g.
  - integrate one missing service into the monitoring
  - write one missing on-call documentation
  - perform one patching task
  - perform a deployment
  - setup a new service from scratch
- For each planned boot camp task write extensive HowTo documentation
- You might need to create a waiting list
- Assign a Ops/DevOps mentor
- Make it as short as possible (few days)
- Advertise this with Dev teams (e.g. in an All-Hands meeting)

## How to execute

- Best case: 100% pair of with a senior colleguage
- Let work boot camp participants on actual Ops/platform team tickets
  - prefer tickets that are for their own team
- Never to many boot camps participants at once, you need a lot of coaching time
- Periodic (daily) review how it is going
- Upon completion: Raise the status of the new DevOps
  - Provide a completion certificate
  - Inform everyone about it
  - Add to "DevOps" mailing lists
  - Add to "DevOps" chats
  - Invite to "DevOps" community of practice
  - Get an anonymous feedback from the new DevOps on the bootcamp
