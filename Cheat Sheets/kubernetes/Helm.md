This cheat sheet is organized as per the typical workflow for Helm3

1. Add a chart repository.
2. Find a chart to install.
3. Install a Helm chart.
4. See the list of what is installed.
5. Upgrade your installation.
6. Delete the installation.

## Add, remove, list, search and Update Repos

```sh
helm repo add [name] [url]   # Add a repository from the internet
helm repo remove [name]      # Remove a repository from your system
helm repo update             # Update repositories
helm repo list               # List chart repositories
helm repo index              # Generate an index file containing charts found in the current directory
helm search [keyword]        # Search charts for a keyword
helm search repo [keyword]   # Search repositories for a keyword
helm search hub [keyword]    # Search Helm Hub
```

## List available packages

To list charts (packages)

```sh
helm search hub wordpress    # Search the Artifact Hub
helm search repo wordpress   # Searches the repositories that you have added to your local helm client (with helm repo add)
```

## Install and Uninstall Apps 

```sh
helm install [name] [chart] --namespace [namespace]    # Install an app in a specific namespace
helm install [name] [chart] --values [yaml-file/url]   # Override the default values with those specified in a file of your choice
helm install [name] --dry-run --debug                  # Run a test install to validate and verify the chart
helm install --upgrade [name]                          # Install or upgrade a release
helm uninstall [release name]                          # Uninstall a release

helm template -f values.yaml .                         # Render all chart resources to stdout
helm template -s templates/some.yaml -f values.yaml .  # Render only a single template file
```

## Chart Management

```sh
helm create [name]             # Create a directory containing (Chart.yaml, values.yaml,charts/ and templates/)
helm package [chart-path]      # Package a chart into a chart archive
helm lint [chart]              # Run tests to examine a chart and identify possible issues
helm show all [chart]          # Inspect a chart and list its contents
helm show chart [chart]        # Display the chart’s definition
helm show values [chart]       # Display the chart's values
helm pull [chart]              # Download a chart
helm pull [chart] --untar --untardir [directory] # Download a chart and extract the archive’s contents into a directory
helm dependency list [chart]   # Display a list of a chart’s dependencies
helm install mychart-0.1.0.tgz --dry-run --debug   # Test installation
```

## Helm Plugin Management

```sh
helm plugin list                          # View all installed plugins 
helm plugin install <plugin URL>          # Install plugins
helm plugin update [plugin1] [plugin2]    # Update plugins
helm plugin uninstall [plugin1]           # Uninstall a plugin
```

## Setup Docker Registry as Helm Chart Repo

```sh
export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
```
## Upgrading, Rollback and Listing releases

```sh
helm upgrade [release] [chart]              # Upgrade a release
helm upgrade [release] [chart] --atomic     # Upgrade and rollback on failure
helm upgrade [release] [chart] --install    # Upgrade or install if it does not yet exist on the system
helm upgrade [release] [chart] --version [version-number]  # Upgrade to a version other than the latest one
helm rollback [release] [revision]          # Roll back a release
helm upgrade --wait <name>                  # Wait for pods to come up

helm ls                                     # List releases in current namespace
helm ls -A                                  # List all releases in all namespaces
helm ls -A -o json | jq  -r '.[] | select(.status = "deployed") | .name' # Find releases in unexpected state

helm get values <release>                   # Print the values the release was installed with
```

## Download Release Information

```sh
helm get all [release]        # Download all the release information
helm get hooks [release]      # Download all hooks
helm get manifest [release]   # Download the manifest
helm get notes [release]      # Download the notes
helm get values [release]     # Download the values file
helm history [release]        # Fetch release history
```

## Get Help and Version info 

```sh
helm --help             # See the general help for Helm
helm [command] help     # See help for a particular command
helm version            # See the installed version of Helm
```

## Release Monitoring 

```sh
helm list                         # List all the available releases in the current namespace
helm list --all-namespaces        # List all the available releases across all namespaces
helm list --namespace [namespace] # List all the releases in a specific namespace
helm list --output [format]       # List all the releases in a specific output format
helm list --filter ‘[expression]’ # Apply a filter to the list of releases using regular (Pearl compatible) expressions
helm status [release]             # See the status of a release
helm history [release]            # See the release history
helm env                          # See information about the Helm client environment
```

## Using Helm in Terraform

Dependency in main.tf

    terraform {
      required_providers {
        helm = {
          version = ">= 3.5"
        }
      }
    }

Declaring Helm ressources with terraform

     resource "helm_release" "myreleasename" {
       name = "myreleasename"
       namespace = "<namespace>"
       create_namespace = <true|false>
       chart = "<path to local chart|chart name>"
     }

## OCI Registries - Openshift

If you have no helm chart registry, but Openshift you can use OCI to store Helm charts directly in the [Openshift registry](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68192150/can-i-store-a-helm-chart-in-openshift-and-make-use-of-it)

    export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
    oc whoami --show-token | helm registry login my-cluster.com -u $(oc whoami) --password-stdin
    helm create mychart
    cd mychart/
    helm chart save . my-cluster.com/$(oc project -q)/mychart:latest
    helm chart push my-cluster.com/$(oc project -q)/mychart:latest
